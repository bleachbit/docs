BleachBit imports cleaning rules from winapp2.ini files giving Windows users 2400+ additional cleaners (and growing) created by the community. [Piriform does not endorse importing "CCleaner data" into BleachBit](https://www.bleachbit.org/news/ccleaner-asks-bleachbit-remove-winapp2ini-importer).

If you are writing new cleaner definitions, it is recommended you write them in [CleanerML](cleanerml) instead of winapp2.ini format because CleanerML is cross-platform, not legally encumbered, and contains many features not available in winapp2.ini.

### Automatically import Winapp2.ini

Check this box, and restart BleachBit to download the winapp2.ini file. Restart BleachBit again for it to take effect.

### Manually import Winapp2.ini

To manually import winapp2.ini cleaners, simply do this:

1.  Download a winapp2.ini file. The CCleaner community organically maintains various files: [winapp2.ini](https://github.com/MoscaDotTo/Winapp2/). This file is not created by endorsed by Piriform, maker of CCleaner. An alternative file [Winapp2.ini plus](https://github.com/bleachbit/winapp2.ini) contains additional entries for BleachBit.
2.  Place the winapp2.ini file in the right directory, which is most of the same directories as [CleanerML](cleanerml). If you install BleachBit (i.e., non-portable mode), below are the recommended directories. See [CleanerML storage](cleanerml) for more options.
    *   Windows XP: ```C:\Documents and Settings\(username)\Application Data\BleachBit\Cleaners\```
    *   Windows Vista/7: ```C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Roaming\BleachBit\Cleaners\```
3.  Restart BleachBit.

### 1.01 Introduction

CleanerML was designed and written by Andrew Ziem from BleachBit.org for BleachBit.  
But the documentation and the CleanerML files are open and therefor can be used by any program that fulfill the license.  
CleanerML is a XML-based markup language to write platform independend system cleaners.  
CleanerML is still under development and new features get added.

### 1.02 The Editor

If you be a Windows User, we recommend you to use Notepad++ as editor of choice!  
Notepad++ is Open Source, too and have a wonderfull code highlighting for XML files and therefor your coding experience get much more colored and visual.  
Notepad++ is available for download here: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

<br>

### 1.03 Be pretty

**Coding style:**  
We use the coding style that xmllint (Linux Program) use! (More to xmllint at the end of this docu...)

**The coding style is:**  
- Throw in with two spaces;  
- Comments can have multiple lines;  
- Comments are done in new lines;  
- And no empty lines in code!
- Cleaner and option IDs are written in small letters;
- Underscore is the conventonal delimiter rather than a dash.

XML files get in repo later formated/tested with xmllint...

### 1.04 Python & "glob" (Unix style pathname pattern expansion)

According to https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html:
The `glob` module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell, [...].
No tilde expansion is done, but `*`, `?`, and character ranges expressed with `[]` will be correctly matched. [...]
Note that [...] glob treats filenames beginning with a dot (`.`) as special cases. [...]  
For a literal match, wrap the meta-characters in brackets. For example, `'[?]'` matches the character `'?'`.  

And now the same a bit more simple:  
In *NIX Systems (Linux, Unix, BSD, Darvin, ...) paths and file names can contain special characters like `*` and `?`.  
To use now wildcard or interrogation mark for a Windows-like search, we have to use in this cases `glob`!  
In the following there will be here and there some cases & examples in the documenation, where `glob` must be used!

<br>

### 1.05 Using Variables

**Use Variables to have the path relative**  
You can use Variables (you should!) to have the path relative!

Writing mostly in Windows with `%windows%` and in Unix with `$unix`... You can use both!

Where to use them: FOLLOWS !!! Not in `.ini`!

### 1.06 Windows Variables

BleachBit allows all the normal operating system variables, and it adds some extras.  
Read about the normal operating system variables (Environment Variables):  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#Default_values

Special:  
Windows itself changes `%ProgramFiles%` for 32-bit processes running in a 64-bit operating system as documented here:  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/winprog64/wow64-implementation-details  
Means, BleachBit shows in "Help - System Information" on 686/x64 systems:  
os.getenv('ProgramFiles') = C:\Program Files (x86)  
os.getenv('ProgramW6432') = C:\Program Files  
...and not:  
os.getenv('ProgramFiles') = C:\Program Files  
os.getenv('ProgramW6432') = C:\Program Files

Code for a multi-value variable "ProgramFiles", that should handle this case.  
Taken from `vuze.xml` from Tobias.  
For more information about multi-value variables, look into chapter "3.08 Define multi-value Variables".  
`  <var name="ProgramFiles">`  
`    <!--`  
`    Windows itself changes %ProgramFiles% for 32-bit processes running in a 64-bit operating system as documented here:`  
`    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/winprog64/wow64-implementation-details`  
`    ...so we used "%SystemDrive%\Program Files\" & "%SystemDrive%\Program Files (x86)\"...`  
`    <value os="windows">%SystemDrive%\Program Files\[ProgramName]</value>`  
`    <value os="windows">%SystemDrive%\Program Files (x86)\[ProgramName]</value>`  
`    ...but %ProgramFiles% & %ProgramFiles(x86)% don't need to be on %SystemDrive% !!!`  
`    So we use: -->`  
`    <value os="windows">%ProgramW6432%\Vuze</value>`  
`    <!-- ...that BleachBit as 32-bit program can find "\Program Files\Vuze" and... -->`  
`    <value os="windows">%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Vuze</value>`  
`    <!-- ...that BleachBit can find "\Program Files (x86)\Vuze" and... -->`  
`    <value os="windows">%ProgramFiles%\Vuze</value>`  
`    <!-- ...that BleachBit can find "\Program Files\Vuze" on a x86 system...`  
`    ...and later, as 64-bit program, "\Program Files\Vuze" (x64)!`  
`    So all cases solved! ;-) Tobias. -->`  
`    <!--`  
`    Linux $$ProgramFiles$$ not yet figured out! I will do this later! Tobias.`  
`    <value os="linux">~/.vuze</value>`  
`    -->`  
`  </var>`

Extra Variables:  
On Windows, BleachBit defines `%cd%` (current directory), `%commonappdata%`, `%documents%`, `%localappdata%` (Windows XP), `%music%`, `%pictures%`, `%video%`, `%localappdatalow%`.

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

### 1.07 Unix Variables

FOLLOWS !!!

Extra Variables:  
On Unix, BleachBit defines `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `$XDG_CACHE_HOME`, ...
For more look here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory

### 1.08 Example Cleaner

Here is an example cleaner:  
https://github.com/bleachbit/bleachbit/blob/master/doc/example_cleaner.xml

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

<H1>2.00 Header</H1>

<br>

### 2.01 First Line

The first line in a new cleaner file is always `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`.  
This identifies the file as a XML file.  
CleanerML files are a special version of XML files.

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

### 2.02 Copyright & Additional Information

Your cleaners should retain the copyright and information header found in `release/*.xml`. Please edit the copyright information accordingly.  
If needed, you can also include extra maintenance information in the header, as found in [release/openshot.xml](https://github.com/az0/cleanerml/blob/master/openshot.xml):

    @url http://full.url.of/software-project
    @tested ok softwareversion, OSnameandversion
    @note Some notes for cleaner maintainers

**Example for a other version:**

    @app Double Commander
    @url https://doublecmd.sourceforge.io/
    @os Windows, Linux, FreeBSD
    @cleanerversion v0.2.5
    @cleanerdate 2019-03-11
    @cleanerby https://github.com/Tobias-B-Besemer
    @tested ok v0.8.4, Windows 7
    @testeddate 2019-03-11
    @testedby https://github.com/Tobias-B-Besemer
    @note As long we have no command="xml", we need to delete the complete file!

<br>

### 2.03 Cleaner Element & ID

The cleaner starts with the `<cleaner>` element.  
Example for a `<cleaner>` header: `<cleaner id="smplayer">`  
`id` is the BleachBit internal ID of the cleaner.

`<cleaner>` can define that the cleaner is OS dependent.  
For more information to this look at: OS dependent parts/cleaners

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

<H1>3.00 General Structure & Configurations per Cleaner</H1>

<br>

### 3.01 Label Element

After that comes `<label>`.  
`<label>` defines the label shown as name (of the cleaner) in the left column of BleachBit.  
Example: `<label>SMPlayer</label>`

`<label>` can have some attributes...

Example: `<label translate="true">Deep Scan - More</label>`  
If the label should be translated by the translators into local.

Example: `<label translators="In Windows 'Run' is the dialog in the Start menu">Run</label>`  
As note for the translators.

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

### 3.02 Description Element

And then we need a description of the cleaner (this time a category!) (shown on the right side of BleachBit).  
Example of a `<description>` element: `<description>Video player</description>`

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

### 3.03 Option Element

Then comes the first `<option>` and then for the `<option>` a `<label>` and a `<description>` (this time a explanaition!), again.  
Example:  
`<cleaner id="tomtom" os="windows">`  
`  <label>TomTom</label>`  
`  <description>Navigation systems</description>`  
`  <option id="cookies">`  
`    <label>Cookies</label>`  
`    <description>Delete cookies, which contain information such as web site preferences, authentication, and tracking identification</description>`

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

### 3.04 More pretty (Label, Option & Description)

Please use (if possible) terms for `<label>`s of `<option>`s and `<description>`s (for `<cleaner>` and `<option>`), that are already used somewhere else in the program!
This makes translation easier, because the term can be maybe be already translated! E.g. don't use "Temp files" or "Temporary Files", use "Temporary files"! (Yes, it is case sensetive!)  
Example:  
`<label>Temporary files</label>`  
`<description>Delete the temporary files</description>`

Use the writing/naming form, that is used by the other cleaners/options, too!  
Example: Don't write "Junk Files", use "Junk files"! (Yes, it is case sensetive!)

We make no dot at the end of `<description>`!

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

### 3.05 Running Element

With `running type="exe"` you can prevent that the cleaner gets executed as long a special program/task is running...  
Example: `<running type="exe" os="windows">firefox.exe</running>`

With `running type="pathname"` you can also prevent that the cleaner gets executed, but as long as a special file exist!  
Example: `<running type="pathname">~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/lock</running>`

Generally it is preffered to have this exe/pathname check included in cleaners!  
And generally the `exe` variation is preffered over the `pathname` variation!

Btw.: `running` need no `search="glob"`, because `running` is always `glob`!

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

### 3.06 OS dependent parts/Cleaners

**Make a part, or the cleaner OS dependent**  
You can make the cleaner (a part, or the hole cleaner) OS dependent by adding the `os=` attribute.

**Example:**  
`<cleaner id="windows" os="windows">`

**Explanaition:**  
Adding the `os=` attribute in the `<cleaner>` element makes the cleaner OS dependent and boosts load time of BleachBit.  
Version 2.1 of BleachBit adds support for `os=` on the elements `action`, `value`, and `running`.  
For `os` can be used `windows`, `linux`, `FreeBSD`, `NetBSD`, `OpenBSD` & `unix`. While `os="unix"` includes Linux, the three BSD systems, and Darwin.

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

### 3.07 Display a Warning

**Display a warning to the user**  
Displays a warning to the user if the cleaner gets selected in BleachBit.

**Example:**  
`<warning>Use the option only if you know what you do!</warning>`

**Explanaition:**  
`<warning>` gets used inside the `<option>` section, on top, as first rule.

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

### 3.08 Define multi-value Variables

**A cleaner can have multiple variables**  
You can define one or more variables in a cleaner with `<var>` and `<value>`.

**Example:**  
`<var name="profile">`  
`  <value os="windows">%USERPROFILE%\.smplayer</value>`  
`  <value os="linux">~/.config/smplayer</value>`  
`</var>`

**Explanaition:**  
Defines with `<var>` the variable "profile" that is after that definded with `<value>` for `os="windows"` and `os="linux"`.

MORE FOLLOWS !!!

Variable syntax: $$multi$$

**Example with two values for one OS:**  
`<var name="profile">  
`  <value os="windows">%LocalAppData%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default</value>`  
`  <value os="linux">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/google-chrome/Default</value>`  
`  <value os="linux">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/google-chrome-beta/Default</value>`  
`</var>`

**Example for a value, when the path includes a "*":**  
`<value search="glob" os="windows">%AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\*</value>`

<br>

<H1>4.00 command="delete"</H1>

<br>

### 4.01 command="delete" search="file"

**Deleting a single file/or an empty folder**  
Deletes a single file or an empty folder in the file system.

**Example:**  
`<action command="delete" search="file" path="$APPDATA\XnView\XnView.db"`

**Explanaition:**  
`command` is always `"delete"`, `search` is always `"file"`, `path` is the path & name of the file to delete.

`<action command="delete" search="file" path="%ProgramFiles%\BiglyBT\*.log"/>`  
**Doesn't work! No wildcards allowed (, yet)!**  
**Use `glob`!**  

`<action command="delete" search="file" path="%ProgramFiles%\BiglyBT*\test.log"/>`  
**Doesn't work! No wildcards allowed (, yet)!**  
**Use `glob`!**  

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

### 4.02 command="delete" search="walk.files"

**Follows**  
Follows

**Example:**  
Follows

**Explanaition:**  
Follows

`<action command="delete" search="walk.files" path="%ProgramFiles%\BiglyBT\*.log"/>`  
**Doesn't work! No wildcards allowed (, yet)!**  
**Use `glob`!**  

`<action command="delete" search="walk.files" path="%ProgramFiles%\BiglyBT*\test.log"/>`  
**Doesn't work! No wildcards allowed (, yet)!**  
**Use `glob`!**  

`<action command="delete" search="walk.files" path="%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Search\Data\Applications\Windows\GatherLogs\SystemIndex\*"/>`  
**Doesn't work! No `*` at the end allowed (, yet)!**  
**Use `glob`!**  

`<action command="delete" search="walk.files" path="%AppData%\Daum\PotPlayer\Log\*"/>`  
If you mean every directory under %AppData%\Daum\PotPlayer\Log\, then walk.files is right, but if you want every file then you want either `search="glob"` (which will not delete recursively) OR remove the wildcard (which will delete recursively)!

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

### 4.03 command="delete" search="walk.all"

**Follows**  
Delete e.g. the content of a folder.

**Example:**  
Follows

**Explanaition:**  
Follows ... walk.all is intended to match directories, not files.

If you add a "*" at the end of a path by `walk.all`, the content of the folder doesn't get deleted!  
`<action command="delete" search="walk.all" path="%windir%\Temp\*"/>`
Explanaition: The "*" is a wildcard for a folder - so the content in the subfolders get deleted!

And this doesn't work, too.  
`<action command="delete" search="walk.all" path="%windir%\Temp\WER*.hdmp"/>`  
Use `glob` instead:  
`<action command="delete" search="glob" path="%windir%\Temp\WER*.hdmp"/>`

This also doesn't work!  
`<action command="delete" search="walk.all" path="%windir%\Temp*\WER1.hdmp"/>`  
Use `glob` instead:  
`<action command="delete" search="glob" path="%windir%\Temp*\WER1.hdmp"/>`

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

### 4.04 command="delete" search="walk.top"

**Deleting a single folder**  
Deletes a single folder including his content in the file system.  
**This feature is implemented starting with BleachBit v3.0!**  
**As some users still stay on Windows XP with BleachBit v2.2 (last version for WinXP) but use new cleaners,  
it is highly recommended to use this new feature at the moment with care!**

**Example:**  
`<action command="delete" search="walk.top" path="%Temp%\DemoFolder\"`

**Explanaition:**  
`command` is always `"delete"`, `search` is always `"walk.top"`, `path` is the path & name of the folder to delete.

**More Examples:**  
`<action command="delete" search="walk.top" path="%ProgramFiles%\BiglyBT*\"/>` will delete in `%ProgramFiles%`  
all folders starting with `BiglyBT*`.  

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

### 4.05 command="delete" search="glob"

**Follows**  
Needed if you e.g. use a wildcard (`*`)!  
**Wherever a glob pattern is supporter, there is no practical limit on the number of wildcards.**

**Example:**  
`<action command="delete" search="glob" path="%windir%\Temp\WER*.hdmp"/>`

**Explanaition:**  
Follows ... and don't go into the subfolders.

Other example:  
`<action command="delete" search="glob" path="%windir%\Temp*\WER1.hdmp"/>`  
There is also a wildcard used!

More to "glob": https://docs.python.org/2/library/glob.html

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

### 4.06 Delete the content of a folder but not the folder itself

**You can delete the content of a folder and not the folder itself**  
Follows

**Example:**  
`<action command="delete" search="walk.all" path="$LocalAppData\Temp\acrord32_sbx"/>`  
`<action command="delete" search="glob" path="$LocalAppData\Temp\acrord32_sbx\*"/>`

**Explanaition:**  
`walk.all` deletes the content of the folder and shows it in BleachBit, while `glob` with a `\` at the end of `path` deletes the folders in the folder.

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

### 4.07 Delete the content of a folder and the folder itself

**You can delete the content of a folder and the folder itself**  
Follows

**Example:**  
`<action command="delete" search="walk.all" path="$LocalAppData\Temp\acrord32_sbx"/>`  
`<action command="delete" search="file" path="$LocalAppData\Temp\acrord32_sbx"/>`

**Explanaition:**  
`walk.all` deletes the content of the folder and shows it in BleachBit, while `file` deletes after that the empty folder itself.

**Starting with BleachBit v3.0 there is `command="delete" search="walk.top"` as a single command to do that!  
But as some users still stay on Windows XP with BleachBit v2.2 (last version for WinXP) but use new cleaners,  
it is highly recommended to use this new feature at the moment with care!**

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

### 4.08 Delete recursive with regex

**Follows**  
Follows

**Example:**  
`<action command="delete" search="walk.files" path="$$profile$$\" regex="\.[Bb][Aa][Kk]$"/>`

**Explanaition:**  
Follows

**More examples:**  
`regex="\.[Bb][Aa][Kk]$"` -> File Extension, not key sensetive  
`regex="^Thumbs\.db$"` -> Exact file name  
`regex="^`[...] -> File name starts with  
`regex="\.`[...] -> File extension is  
`regex="\.log(\.[0-9]+)?$` -> File extension is `.log.[0-9]` + The plus will match one or more such as 1 or 99 and the question mark makes the number optional  
Test the logic of your regex string: https://regex101.com/

Works also with `walk.all` & `glob` (`file` too, but makes no sence)!

[Back to index](#content-of-the-chapter)

<br>

### 4.09 command="delete" search="deep"

**Follows**  
`command="delete" search="deep"` searches across the file system, currently just the user profile, and it is optimized for speed to search for multiple patterns at once.

**Example:**  
`<action command="delete" search="deep" cache="false" regex="\.[Ll][Oo][Gg]$"/>`

**Explanaition:**  
Follows

**More examples:**  
For more `regex` examples look one chapter above under "Delete recursive with regex"!

If you find in a cleaner a `search="deep"` with a `cache="false"` (or a `cache="true"`), then you can delete the `cache="false"` (or `cache="true"`)!
This feature was never fully implemented and later removed, again!
